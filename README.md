## Memes:
This might not be my favorite meme, but I felt it was a good one for here: [Kitty says what we're all thinking](https://www.memecreator.org/static/images/memes/5225847.jpg)

## Current CIS-641 Project:
[Tank Game](https://nweenglish.github.io/GVSU-CIS641-Sea-Pound/)
The premise of this game is that you, the player, control a 2D tank that can move around a map and shoot missiles out of. The maps will have enemies that the player must defend against in two different game modes. The first game mode has the player search through the map and destroys objectives. The other game mode sees the player defend against endless waves of enemies and must try to survive.
The tech stack for creating this game is the Unity game engine and C#.
While the project itself is super fun and allows for me to see how games can be built, there is another point to this project. The other side of this project is the technical documents writing and project management. Every aspect, from analysis and design to planning out sprints, needs to be planned because the project needs an answer for what, why, when, and how for each and every case.
